Our app features a login screen for entering your username and password.

Categories such as food, clothing, transportation, bills, and miscellaneous expenditures are represented, giving you a clear visual ratio of your spending.

If you wish to add a new expense, simply click the plus button at the bottom of the screen to access the 'Add Expense' page. Here, you can input the amount, specify the transaction category, select the payee, enter the date, and choose your preferred payment mode.
